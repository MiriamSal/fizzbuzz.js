## Answer
-------
*Question 1. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain what the following lines of code do

```let  fizzBuzz = fs.readFileSync('./src/js/fizz-buzz.js'); 
eval( fizzBuzz + `\nexports.FizzBuzz = FizzBuzz;`)

* Creatating a block variable (let) named fizzBuss (A let variable can be modified) 
* The = , is setting the variable eq to a method (fs.readFileSync) which purpose is to return the content of the file named ('./src/js/fizz-buzz.js').
* The eval() is a function that evaluates or executes an argument. In this example the argument is (fizzBuzz + `\nexports.FizzBuzz = FizzBuzz;`), 
* The \n means new line.
* I think here the eval function is an expression and not an statement. Expression = evaluation, statement = execution. ?
* Which means that when we call fizzBuzz in our code we get the content of the file ('./src/js/fizz-buzz.js') evaluated and exported.```
-------
*Question 2. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain why we are placing the (let fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz) outside the it block?

```* We are declaring the "let fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz" outside the "it block" because we want to use it for more than one test, so that way we don`t have to repete that code.

* Question 3. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain the difference between using === and == in JS?

*The operators are equality comparisons, the difference is that, == can compare different data types, and === can only compare the same type of data.
-------
*Question 4. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain why we are moving (number % 5 === 0) to the top?

*We move (number % 5 === 0) to the top because once the computer finds a true statment, it executes the code and exits the statement.
-------
*Question 5. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain the difference between feature and unit test

*The unit test runs everything the user can`t see and the feature tests run whats visible to the user, the application.
-------
*Question 6. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain what expectations in the context of testing are

*Writing expectations are our way of defining our expected output, and guides us in what implementation code to write. Whitout expectation the test will automatically go green.

#Question 7. In your README to the best of your knowledge please write a line to line explanation of what is happening in this code

<!-- <script src="src/js/fizz-buzz.js"></script>                            Using source fizz-buss.js
    <script>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {               Adding listener to page, when loaded....
            let button = document.getElementById('button')                  Saving button element in a varable named 'button'
            let displayDiv = document.getElementById('display_answer')      Saving the div for displaying the output in a varable named 'displayDiv'
            button.addEventListener('click', () =>{                         When user cklicks on button...
                let value = document.getElementById('value').value          Saving a varable named 'value' with user input
                let fizzBuzz = new FizzBuzz                                 Executes method FizzBuzz and save it in a varable named 'fizzbuzz'
                let result = fizzBuzz.check(value)                          Executes method check number and save it in a varable named 'result'          
                displayDiv.innerHTML = result;                              Displays result to user
            })
        })
    </script> -->

*Question 8. In your README to the best of your knowledge please explain what a CDN (Content Delivery Network) is?
*CDN means Contant delivery networks. CDN delivers content to users over networks, and one of it`s greater benefits are the capability to lower the distance between users. Which results in faster delivery of content. That it self also gives me as a user a better experience, which is of importance for the company im visiting/ using content from.
